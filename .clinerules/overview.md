# Project Overview

This file provides a general overview of the AI Services WordPress plugin.

## Purpose

The AI Services WordPress plugin provides a developer-focused API that allows other WordPress plugin developers to easily integrate and leverage various AI capabilities within their own plugins. It acts as a provider-agnostic abstraction layer, enabling communication with different AI models from various providers through a uniform API, abstracting away the complexities of individual provider APIs.

## Key Features

- **Provider-Agnostic AI Client:** Offers a consistent API for interacting with AI models from different providers.
- **Comprehensive AI Capabilities:** Supports a wide range of AI features, including text generation, text streaming, image generation, function calling, and multimodal input/output, with more to come.
- **AI Playground:** Includes a WordPress admin screen that provides an intuitive user interface for end users to explore available AI capabilities, services, and models.

## Target Audience

The primary target audience for this plugin is other WordPress plugin developers who want to incorporate AI features into their plugins without needing to handle the complexities of multiple AI provider APIs. Additionally, the plugin's AI Playground feature caters to end users who wish to experiment with AI capabilities directly within the WordPress admin area. The AI Playground can also be helpful to developers that would like to assess the AI Services plugin's capabilities through an intuitive UI before starting to use it for building their own AI features in a plugin.
