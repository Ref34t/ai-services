# Mistral AI Service Integration

Directory: `includes/Mistral/`

This directory contains the integration logic for the Mistral AI service, including the API client, service definition, and text generation model. It enables the plugin to interact with the Mistral AI API for text generation and other AI-related tasks.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the code within this directory is to:

-   Implement the `Mistral_AI_Service` class, which extends the `Abstract_AI_Service` and provides the specific implementation for interacting with the Mistral AI API.
-   Define the `Mistral_AI_Text_Generation_Model` class, which represents a Mistral AI text generation model and extends the `OpenAI_Compatible_AI_Text_Generation_Model`.
-   Handle authentication, API requests, and response parsing for the Mistral AI service.
-   Expose the Mistral AI service and its models to the plugin's AI services infrastructure.

## Key Classes

-   **`Mistral_AI_Service`**: This class is responsible for registering the Mistral AI service, handling authentication, and managing the available models. It implements the `With_API_Client` interface and uses the `Generic_AI_API_Client` for making API requests.
-   **`Mistral_AI_Text_Generation_Model`**: This class represents a Mistral AI text generation model. It extends the `OpenAI_Compatible_AI_Text_Generation_Model` and implements the `With_Function_Calling` and `With_Multimodal_Input` interfaces, providing support for function calling and multimodal input capabilities.

## Architecture

The `Mistral_AI_Service` class utilizes the `Generic_AI_API_Client` to communicate with the Mistral AI API. It defines the base URL and API version for the service and handles the creation of API requests. The `Mistral_AI_Text_Generation_Model` class extends the `OpenAI_Compatible_AI_Text_Generation_Model`, leveraging its functionality for text generation tasks.

The directory follows the structure defined in `includes/Services/` for AI service integrations.
